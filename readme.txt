== Description ==

[Typekit](http://www.typekit.com) offer a service that allows you to select from a range of hundreds of high quality fonts for your WordPress website. The fonts are applied using the font-face standard, so they are standards compliant, fully licensed and accessible.

This plugin allows you to embed and use Typekit fonts in your WordPress blog without having to edit your theme's header or CSS files.

To use this plugin you need to sign up with Typekit, install this plugin and then configure CSS for your site. Detailed instructions are available on the plugin's settings page.

Compatible with both WordPress and WordPress MU (WPMU).

This plugin is designed to function securely with both WordPress and WordPress MU. When the JavaScript Embed Code is entered on the settings page, the user account id is extracted from the embed code and the correctly formed Typekit Embed Code is included in the site header, so it is not possible to use the Embed Code field to include arbitrary JavaScript. The Custom CSS field is also filtered, and doesn't allow any HTML code to be entered.

Installation of this plugin is simple:

1. Download the plugin files and copy to your Plugins directory.

1. Go to the WordPress Dashboard, and use Settings, Typekit Fonts to enter the whole 2 lines of your Typekit embed code.
